# Algo-Trading-MACD
This repository hosts an Algorithmic Trading project which I built using the Moving Average Convergence Divergence strategy!

## Overview
- I have the extracted real time stock data from the latest version of the Yahoo Finance API
- I have decided to run this algorithm on 3 desired securities, which differ based on volatility
- I have constructed my own backtesting.py to evaluate the performance of the model

## Setting Up
git clone https://github.com/arnav0401/Algo-Trading-MACD

## Running the Program
1. Get the latest versioN from the Yahoo Finance API
2. Extract out the stock data by entering your desired Ticker Symbol
3. Select your desired Time Frame & Interval Period
4. Run the calculation and plotting functions by passing in your extracted DataFrame
5. Watch the results!!
